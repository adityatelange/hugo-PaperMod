# Contributing to Hugo Clarity

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Hugo Clarity is 
[open-source](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/blob/master/LICENSE.md),
and contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place
to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit others,
and are **greatly appreciated**!

When contributing, especially for the first time, consider starting by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/issues/new/choose)
so you can get feedback from the maintainers and avoid unnecessary work.

**Note:** Hugo Clarity has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting support and asking questions

If you have questions about the project, are encountering something and aren't
sure if it's a bug, or if you'd like to discuss an idea before filing a feature
request, please use 
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/discussions)
rather than posting an issue.

## Filing issues and requesting features

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe
you'd like a new feature? You can help us by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/issues/new/choose).
Before you create an issue, make sure to
[search the current issues](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/issues)
-- your issue may have already been addressed!

Once a bug has been confirmed or a feature has been approved, you are welcome
to [submit a Pull Request](#how-to-submit-a-pull-request) -- if you have the
solution, please do tell us about it!

### Helping us fix bugs

We want to help you solve any problems you might be facing with the theme! In
order to help us help you, create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what
  environment, etc.
- _Unique._ If other bug reports already exist about the same issue, add to
  them rather than creating a new one.
- _Scoped to a single bug._ One bug per report. We know this might be a little
  tedious, but it makes it *much* easier to keep track of which bugs are fixed
  and which still need work to be done.

## How to submit a Pull Request

1. Search our repository for open or closed
   [Pull Requests](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
   that relate to your issue. You don't want to duplicate effort, and if one
   already exists you can collaborate on that.

2. Ensure that you plan to work consistent with the
   [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). This
   confirms to us that you have the right to submit your contribution to an
   open-source project (i.e. it is not proprietary or trade-secret code) and
   that the record of your contribution will be recorded. **This is required
   in order to contribute to Hugo Clarity**, and you'll need to confirm your
   consent when committing, as shown below.

3. [Fork the project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
   then checkout your fork using
   [Gitpod](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/blob/master/README.md#option-1a-development-in-the-browser)
   or
   [locally on your machine](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/blob/master/README.md#option-1b-development-on-your-machine)

4. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b amazing_feature
   ```

5. Do your work.

6. Commit your changes:

   ```sh
   git commit -s -m 'Adding an amazing new feature'
   ```

  The `-s` flag is the short form of `--signoff` and signals to us that you are
  abiding by the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (see step 2, above).

  If you are in an environment in which you cannot provide this cryptographic
  signoff (for instance, Gitpod) you will need to leave a comment on the PR you
  submit confirming that you certify compliance with the DCO.

7. Repeat steps 5-6 as necessary.

8. Unless your PR is documentation-only, **test your work 
   [using Hugo extended](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)
   to build a site.** When you submit your PR we'll run test-builds of a Hugo
   site with your PR applied, so you'll save time if you fix any build issues
   before submitting.

9. Push the branch:

   ```sh
   git push origin amazing_feature
   ```

10. [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity/compare?expand=1)
   by
   "[comparing across forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)"
   and filling out the form. Completing the PR template as requested will ensure
   your work gets reviewed by maintainers promptly.
