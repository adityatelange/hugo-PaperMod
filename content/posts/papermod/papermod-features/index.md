### Intro

- **We'll be using `yml/yaml` format for all examples down below, I recommend using `yml` over `toml` as it is easier to read.**

- You can find any [YML to TOML](https://www.google.com/search?q=yml+to+toml) converters if necessary.

---

### Assets (js/css)

The following is enabled by default

- [minification](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/minification/) - makes the assets size smallest as possible.
- [bundling](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/bundling/) - bundles all the styles in one single asset
- [fingerprint/intergity](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/fingerprint/) check.

### Default Theme light/dark/auto

```yml {linenos=true}
params:
  # defaultTheme: light
  # defaultTheme: dark
  defaultTheme: auto # to switch between dark or light according to browser theme
```

</details>

---

### Theme Switch Toggle (enabled by default)

Shows icon besides title of page to change theme

To disable it :

```yml {linenos=true}
disableThemeToggle: true
```

You can refer following table for better understanding...

| `defaultTheme` | `disableThemeToggle` | checks local storage? | checks system theme? | Info              |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |

```

and add the following to it

```

**Note:** Archives Layout does not support Multilingual Month Translations.

### Search Page

PaperMod uses [Fuse.js Basic](https://fusejs.io/getting-started/different-builds.html#explanation-of-different-builds) for search functionality

Add the following to site config, `hugo.yml`

```yml {linenos=true,hl_lines=[5]}
outputs:
  home:
    - HTML
    - RSS
    - JSON # necessary for search
```

Create a page with `search.md` in `content` directory with following content

```yml {linenos=true,hl_lines=[3]}
---
title: "Search" # in any language you want
layout: "search" # necessary for search
# url: "/archive"
# description: "Description for Search"
summary: "search"
placeholder: "placeholder text in search input box"
---
```

To hide a particular page from being searched, add it in post's frontmatter

```yml {linenos=true}
searchHidden: true
```

ex: [search.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/exampleSite/content/search.md)

> Search Page also has Key bindings:
>
> - Arrow keys to move up/down the list
> - Enter key (return) or Right Arrow key to go to the highlighted page
> - Escape key to clear searchbox and results

For Multilingual use `search.<lang>.md` ex. `search.es.md`.

**Note:** Search will work only on current language, user is currently on !

**Customizing Fusejs Options**

Refer https://fusejs.io/api/options.html for Options, Add those as shown below.

```yml {linenos=true}
params:
  fuseOpts:
    isCaseSensitive: false
    shouldSort: true
    location: 0
    distance: 1000
    threshold: 0.4
    minMatchCharLength: 0
    # limit: 10 # refer: https://www.fusejs.io/api/methods.html#search
    keys: ["title", "permalink", "summary", "content"]
```

---

### Draft Page indication

adds `[draft]` mark to indicate draft pages.

---

### Post Cover Image

In post's page-variables add :

```yml {linenos=true}
cover:
  image: "<image path/url>"
  # can also paste direct link from external site
  # ex. https://i.ibb.co/K0HVPBd/paper-mod-profilemode.png
  alt: "<alt text>"
  caption: "<text>"
  relative: false # To use relative path for cover image, used in hugo Page-bundles
```

When you include images in the [Page Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), multiple sizes of the image will automatically be provided using the HTML5 `srcset` field.

To reduce generation time and size of the site, you can disable this feature using

```yml {linenos=true}
params:
  cover:
    responsiveImages: false
```

To enable hyperlinks to the full image size on post pages, use

```yml {linenos=true}
params:
  cover:
    linkFullImages: true
```

---

### Share Buttons on post

Displays Share Buttons at Bottom of each post

to show share buttons add

```yml
params:
  ShowShareButtons: true
```

---

### Show post reading time

Displays Reading Time (the estimated time, in minutes, it takes to read the content.)

To show reading time add

```yml
Params:
  ShowReadingTime: true
```

---

### Show Table of Contents (Toc) on blog post

Displays ToC on blog-pages

To show ToC add following to page-variables

```yml
ShowToc: true
```

To keep Toc Open **by default** on a post add following to page-variables:

```yml
TocOpen: true
```

---

### BreadCrumb Navigation

Adds BreadCrumb Navigation above Post's Title to show subsections and Navigation to Home

```yml
params:
  ShowBreadCrumbs: true
```

Can be disabled for particular page's front-matter

```yml
---
ShowBreadCrumbs: false
---
```

---

### Edit Link for Posts

Add a button to suggest changes by using the file path of the post to link to a edit destination.

For site config use:

```yml
Params:
  editPost:
    URL: "https://github.com/<path_to_repo>/content"
    Text: "Suggest Changes" # edit text
    appendFilePath: true # to append file path to Edit link
```

Can be modified for individual pages

```yml
---
editPost:
  URL: "https://github.com/<path_to_repo>/content"
  Text: "Suggest Changes" # edit text
  appendFilePath: true # to append file path to Edit link
---
```

The example above would yield the following link for the post file `posts/post-name.md`:
`https://github.com/<path_to_repo>/content/posts/post-name.md`

| Parameter                 | Required | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `editPost.URL`            | true     | -             |
| `editPost.appendFilePath` | false    | `false`       |
| `editPost.Text`           | false    | `Edit`        |

Since the link generated is a regular HTML anchor tag `<a href=...>`, you can
also use other URL schemas like `mailto://`, e.g.
`URL: "mailto://mail@example.com?subject=Suggesting changes for "`

---

### Other Posts suggestion below a post

```yml
params:

```

### Enhanced SEO

**Enabled only when `env: production`**

- [Rich Results/Snippets Support](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7506797?hl=en)

#### Twitter Cards Support

- The Twitter Cards metadata, except `twitter:image` should not require
  additional configuration, since it is generated from metadata that
  you should already have (for instance the page title and description).
- The `twitter:image` uses the [Post Cover Image](#post-cover-image), if present.
- In the absence of a cover images, the first image from the `images`
  frontmatter (a list) is used.
  ```yaml
  images:
    - image_01.png
    - image_02.png
  ```
- Finally, if neither of those are provided, `twitter:image` comes from the first
  [Page Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)
  image with `feature` in the name, with a fallback to the first image with
  `cover` or `thumbnail` in the name.

#### OpenGraph support

- The OpenGraph metadata, except `og:image` should not require
  additional configuration, since it is generated from metadata that
  you should already have (for instance the page title and description).
- The `og:image` uses the [Post Cover Image](#post-cover-image), if present.
- In the absence of a cover images, the first image from the `images`
  frontmatter (a list) is used.
  ```yaml
  images:
    - image_01.png
    - image_02.png
  ```
- Finally, if neither of those are provided, `og:image` comes from the first
  [Page Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)
  image with `feature` in the name, with a fallback to the first image with
  `cover` or `thumbnail` in the name.
- For pages, you can also add audio (using frontmatter `audio: filename.ext`) and/or
