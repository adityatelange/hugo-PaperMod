## Override theme template

By Hugo's Lookup Order, you can override any part of a theme that you want. The following is a quick example.

Let's say you wish the `list` was different. All you have to do is copy the `list` template:

```shell
your-site/themes/papermod/layouts/_defaults/list.html
```

And paste it under your own `layouts` folder:

```shell
your-site/layouts/_defaults/list.html
```

Then you're free to make any changes you want to the `list`.
When Hugo builds your site, your copy of `list.html` will be used instead of the theme's `list.html`.

## Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource ... ?

Read about How Subresource Integrity helps: [Subresource_Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)

Why was the `asset` not loading ? : [How_browsers_handle_Subresource_Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity#How_browsers_handle_Subresource_Integrity)

**Solution:**

Set the following in `config.yml`

```yml {linenos=true}
params:
  assets:
    disableFingerprinting: true
```

## Bundling Custom css with theme's assets

- For adding custom css to be bundled inside one minimized css

Create folder in yout project directory as

```
.(site root)
├── config.yml
├── content/
├── theme/hugo-PaperMod/
└── assets/
    └── css/
        └── extended/  <---
            ├── custom_css1.css <---
            └── any_name.css   <---
```

All `css` files inside `assets/css/extended` will be bundled !

**Note**: blank.css is just the placeholder so that it doesn't break the theme when no files are present under `assets/css/extended`

## Custom Head / Footer

Custom css/js can be added by way mentioned below.

```
.(site root)
├── config.yml
├── content/
├── theme/hugo-PaperMod/
└── layouts
    ├── partials
    │   ├── comments.html
    │   ├── extend_footer.html <---
    │   └── extend_head.html   <---
    └── robots.txt
```

Create a html page in directory structure as shown above.

Contents of `extend_head.html` will be added to `head` of page.

and contents of `extend_footer.html` will be added to bottom of page.

---

## Add menu to site

You can add menu entries which will appear in the header of every page.

To do so, add a `menu` section to your site's `config.yml`:

```yml {linenos=true}
menu:
  main:
    - identifier: categories
      name: categories
      url: /categories/
      weight: 10
    - identifier: tags
      name: tags
      url: /tags/
      weight: 20
    - identifier: example
      name: example.org
      url: https://example.org
      weight: 30
```

`name` controls what will be displayed for the menu entry.
`url` sets the URL that the entry points to.
`weight` is used to control the positioning of entries.

For more information on menus, see the [Hugo wiki page](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/).

## Pin a Post

Post can be pinned/ displayed top on the list by adding a `weight=<num>` var to page-variables

example:

```yml {linenos=true}
---
title: "My Important post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
weight: 1
---
```

```yml {linenos=true}
---
title: "My 2nd Important post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
weight: 2
---
```

## Adding Custom Favicon(s)

We support the following paths under `/static` directory
and can be added accordingly.

- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon-16x16.png`
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `safari-pinned-tab.svg`

1. Favicon(s) can be generated by [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io) and can be simply put in `/static` folder.

2. Other way is to add favicon(s) NOT located in `/static` folder.

   In site config add the following:

   ```yml {linenos=true}
   params:
     assets:
       favicon: "<link / absolute url>"
       favicon16x16: "<link / absolute url>"
       favicon32x32: "<link / absolute url>"
       apple_touch_icon: "<link / absolute url>"
       safari_pinned_tab: "<link / absolute url>"
   ```

   Note: `absolute url` means direct links to external resource: ex. `https://web.site/someimage.png`

```yml {linenos=true}
params:
  assets:
    favicon: "/favicon.ico"
    favicon16x16: "/favicon-16x16.png"
    favicon32x32: "/favicon-32x32.png"
    apple_touch_icon: "/apple-touch-icon.png"
    safari_pinned_tab: "/safari-pinned-tab.svg"
```

## Centering image in markdown

Add `#center` after image to center align an image

```md {linenos=true}
![name](path/to/image.png#center)
```

**When using [`figure`](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) shortcode**

use `align=center` to center image with captions

```md {linenos=true}
{{</* figure align=center src="image.jpg" */>}}
```

## Using Hugo's Syntax highlighter "chroma"

1. Disable Highlight.js in site `config.yml`

   ```yml {linenos=true}
   params:
     assets:
       disableHLJS: true
   ```

2. Set hugo's markdown styling in site `config.yml`

   ```yml {linenos=true}
   markup:
     highlight:
       # anchorLineNos: true
       codeFences: true
       guessSyntax: true
       lineNos: true
       # noClasses: false
       style: monokai
   ```

3. If you want `lineNos: true`, the background won't be proper.
   This will only work with `noClasses: false` or `pygmentsUseClasses: true`.
   Read [Generate Syntax Highlighter CSS](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#generate-syntax-highlighter-css)

   Add the following to `assets/css/extended/custom.css`

   ```css {linenos=true}
   .chroma {
     background-color: unset;
   }
   ```

## Search not working ?

If you are using a CDN to server assets from a different domain, search would break

Why? Take a look at [fastsearch.js#L35](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/blob/fb4988cfb6d0d6e4e489f17d89f0fa618def3396/assets/js/fastsearch.js#L35).

We fetch the `index.json` (where the search function looks for the keywords typed) one level up of the website `search.min.js` is hosted on.

We have used this insted of assigning `baseURL` so as to work with multilingual websites ex. `example.com/fr/` and websites being placed under a subdirectory ex. `example.com/blog/`.

To fix for _single_ language websites hosting assets from CDN, this you may [override](#override-theme-template) [fastsearch.js#L35](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/blob/fb4988cfb6d0d6e4e489f17d89f0fa618def3396/assets/js/fastsearch.js#L35) and placing appropriate URL as in

```js {linenos=true}
xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com/index.json");
```
